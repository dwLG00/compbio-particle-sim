Bad code, can't figure out full physics.
psim.py => General particle sim code
pmath.py => Vector class for better 2D math (prob can do same thing with numpy sorry)
ptypes.py => More specific particle classes than psim.py (didn't work very well)
plife.py => Trying to copy verbatim the JS particle life sim (works better but still a bit weird)
main.py => Running psim.py-based code (doesn't work well)
